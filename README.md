# Next.js + MUI Quickstack (MVP)

This project provides a minimal setup to get React applications up and running quickly using Next.js and Material UI (MUI). It's configured with TypeScript for enhanced development experience.

## Core Technologies

*   **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** The React Framework for Production. Handles routing (using the App Router), server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and more.
*   **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **[Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/):** A popular React UI framework providing pre-built components following Material Design principles.
*   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/):** A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution (used here for theme toggling).
*   **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/):** Pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript.
